The **Goldanniyatech Research & Development** monorepository contains multiple projects I'm developing from scratch, either for professional research purposes or for fun! To give an overview of its content, you will find the following projects: 
- **Textual Game Projects**, developed for an extensive research and comparison over the vanilla version of various programming language. There is only one game project per language, which also includes a fantasy-like console with various functionalities (BIOS, Memory Card manager, etc.) to increase experimentation. 
- **Game Development Tools** using popular game engines (Unreal and Unity) to test multiple functionalities, 
- **Web Development** projects.  

The following technologies are currently supported in this repository: 
- **Programming Languages**: C ‚Ä¢ C++ ‚Ä¢ C# ‚Ä¢ Python
- **Game Engines**: Unity ‚Ä¢ Unreal Engine
Old technologies might be used in some projects (like MaxScript scripting language or Panda3D engine), but those are deprecated projects, not supported at all. 
 
## Projects Overview

üåÄ **Legendary Warlord**: a **C & C++** textual adventure game. 

üöß **Royal Palace**: a deprecated minigame project using the **Panda3D** game engine with the **Python** language. 

üåÄ **Shadow Devil**: a **C#** textual adventure game.

üåÄ **Selenniya**: a Web SASS (**SCSS**) stylesheet, supporting 3 formats (Desktop, mobile-responsive and print), while keeping high-level animations. Only the CSS Reset is always applied when importing the stylesheet. It comes in two versions: Selenniya and Selenniya-Minified for performance (generated with a Python script). 

üöß **Tiger Tools**: a deprecated set of scripts for **Blender (Python)** and **3DS Max (MaxScript)**, used for various purposes.
