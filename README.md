# 3D Game Development Research Overview

⚠️ *Note: this repository is currently under heavy development and these projects or mini-games might not work (at all). Only a Release is intended to be used.* 

This **Game Engine Research Laboratory** is a collection of various scripts, prototypes and mini-games made with multiple Game Engines & DCC, mainly for Research Purposes. My main rule is to use only Game Engines under development or *at least* under maintenance in the past two years. However, I want to focus on the most popular and up-to-date game engines, i.e., Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine.

Feel free to learn or re-use this content in any of your (commercial) projects, as long as you properly credit me.

Each project has been tested with the *version* mentioned below, and should be working right off the bat.
