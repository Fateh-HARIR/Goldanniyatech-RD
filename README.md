The **Goldanniyatech Research & Development** monorepository contains multiple projects I'm developing from scratch, either for professional research purposes or for fun!  
⚠️ *Note: these projects are not intended for production. Use them at your own risks*
 
## Projects Overview

🌀 **Legendary Warlord**: a **C & C++** textual adventure game. Usually, I develop Textual Game Projects for an extensive research and comparison over the vanilla version of various programming language. It includes a fantasy-like console with various functionalities (BIOS, Memory Card manager, etc.) to increase experimentation. 

🚧 **Royal Palace**: a deprecated minigame project using the **Panda3D** game engine with the **Python** language. 

🌀 **Shadow Devil**: a **C#** textual adventure game.

🌀 **Selenniya**: a Web SASS (**SCSS**) stylesheet, supporting 3 formats (Desktop, mobile-responsive and print), while keeping high-level animations. Only the CSS Reset is always applied when importing the stylesheet. It comes in two versions: Selenniya and Selenniya-Minified for performance (generated with a Python script). 

🚧 **Tiger Tools**: a deprecated set of scripts for **Blender (Python)** and **3DS Max (MaxScript)**, used for various purposes. 

🌀 **Warriors Journey**: a **Python** textual adventure game.
