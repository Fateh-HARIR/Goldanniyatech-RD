# 3D Game Engines Research Overview

⚠️ *Note: this repository is currently under heavy development and these projects or mini-games might not work (at all). Only a Release is intended to be used. Use it at your own risks* ⚠️

This **Game Engine Research Laboratory** is a collection of various mini-games & prototypes made with multiple Game Engines, mainly for Research Purposes. My main rule is to use only Game Engines under development or *at least* under maintenance in the past two years. However, I want to focus on the most popular and up-to-date game engines, i.e., Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine.

Feel free to learn or re-use this content in any of your (commercial) projects, as long as you properly credit me. 

⚠️ This repository will not contain highly-detailed 3D models, but only textureless Low-Poly Models. The goal of this repo is to focus mainly on Gameplay scripting.
